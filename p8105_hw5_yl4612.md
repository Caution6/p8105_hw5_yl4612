### Problem 1

Describe the raw data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## 
    ## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Letâ€™s look at this a bit.

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Test Baltimore, MD and get data.

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)
  ) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Test each of the cities in dataset and get data.

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Create a plot.

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

### Problem 2

Create a tidy dataframe.

``` r
path_df =  
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))
    ) %>% 
  separate(
    path,
    into = c("folder_name", "arm", "dash", "subject_id", "file_type"),
    sep = c(9, 12, 13, 15)
  ) %>% 
  select(-folder_name, -file_type, -dash) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_prefix = "week_",
    names_to = "week_number",
    values_to = "observations"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    arm = case_when(
      arm == "con" ~ "control",
      arm == "exp" ~ "experimental"
    )
  )
```

Make a spaghetti plot.

``` r
path_df %>% 
  mutate(
    arm_sub_id = str_c(arm, subject_id, sep = "_")
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week_number, y = observations, group = arm_sub_id, color = arm)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time",
    x = "Week Number",
    y = "Observations"
    )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_yl4612_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

According to the spaghetti plot, experimental group has a general trend
of increment, while control group does not.
